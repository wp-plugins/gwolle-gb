Gwolle-GB is the WordPress guestbook you've just been looking for. Beautiful and easy.


== Description ==

Gwolle-GB is the WordPress guestbook you've just been looking for. Beautiful and easy.
Gwolle Guestbook is not just another guestbook for WordPress. The goal is to provide an easy and slim way to integrate
a guestbook into your WordPress powered site. Don't use your 'comment' section the wrong way - install Gwolle-GB and
have a real guestbook.


Current features include:

* Easy to use guestbook frontend with a simple form for visitors of your website.
* Widget to display your last or your best entries.
* Simple and clean admin interface that integrates seamlessly into WordPress admin.
* Dashboard Widget to easily manage the latest entries from your Admin dashboard.
* Easy import from other guestbooks into Gwolle-GB.
* Notification by mail when a new entry has been posted.
* Moderation, so that you can check an entry before it is visible in your guestbook (all optional).
* Akismet integration for fighting spam.
* Custom Anti-Spam question for fighting spam, too.
* reCAPTCHA integration for fighting spam, as well.
* Simple Form Builder to select which form-fields you want to use.
* Option List with the parts of each entry that you want to show.
* Localisation. Own languages can be added very easily, so please send po-files to marcel at timelord.nl.
* Different-styled admin entries, so that the visitor can tell which entry is written by the 'real admin' (optional).
* A log for each entry, so that you know which member of the staff released and edited a guestbook-entry to the public and when.
* IP-address and host-logging with link to WHOIS query site.
* Smiley integration (uses the WordPress smiley engine).
* Easy uninstall routine for complete removal of all database changes.

... and all that integrated in the stylish WordPress look.

You may have another guestbook installed. That's great, because Gwolle-GB enables you to import entries easily.
The importer does not delete any of your data, so you can go back to your previous setup without loss of data, if you want to.
Trying Gwolle-GB is as easy as 1-2-3.

= Import / Export =

Import is supported from:

* DMSGuestbook.
* WordPress comments from a specific page.
* Gwolle-GB itself, with Export supported as well.


Please note: At the moment, Gwolle-GB does *not* work with WordPress MU.


= Languages =

* bg_BG, Kostadin Petrichkov
* cs_CZ, Jan Korous
* de_DE, Jenny Gaulke and Eckhard Henkel
* es_ES, José Luis Sanz Ruiz
* fi, Ilkka Kivelä and Timo Hintsa
* fr_FR, [Charles-Aurélien PONCET](http://www.brie-informatique.com/) and [Florence Bourmault-Gohin](http://www.mon-coin-de-bourgogne.fr)
* it_IT, Mariachiara Corradini
* nl_NL, [Marcel Pol](http://zenoweb.nl)
* pl_PL, Andrzej Sobaniec

Other languages can be added very easily, so please send po-files to marcel at timelord.nl.


= Demo =

Check out the demo at [http://demo.zenoweb.nl](http://demo.zenoweb.nl/wordpress-plugins/gwolle-gb/)

== Installation ==

= Installation =

* Install the plugin through the admin page "Plugins".
* Alternatively, unpack and upload the contents of the zipfile to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
* Place '[gwolle_gb]' in a page. That's it.
* You may disable comments in this post or page, because it may look confusing when there's the possibility to write a guestbook entry.

As an alternative for the shortcode, you can use the function `show_gwolle_gb();` to show the guestbook in your templates.
It couldn't be easier.

= Updating from an old version =

With version 1.0 there have been some changes:

* Gwolle-GB uses the Shortcode API now. Make sure your Guestbook page uses [gwolle_gb] instead of the old one.
* The entries that are visible to visitors have changed. Make sure to check if you have everything
  visible that you want and nothing more.
* CSS has changed somewhat. If you have custom CSS, you want to check if it still applies.

If you have a feature request please use the forum on WordPress.org.

= Licence =

The plugin itself is released under the GNU General Public License; a copy of this licence can be found at the licence homepage or
in the gwolle-gb.php file at the top.

For the licences regarding the use of reCAPTCHA you may ask the authors.

= Todo list =

The current todolist is slowly getting shorter. If you do have a feature request, please post it on the support forum.

* More translations (send them in).
* Form: Add smileys to the form, maybe even emoji?
* Editor: add options to change the date.
* Frontend: add option to show only one entry with $_GET entry_id.
* Frontend: Add pagination link for all entries (optional).
* Form: there is a request for a country dropdown, is it a good idea?
* SEO: add title and desc of first entry to SEO meta in html (is this possible?).

= API, add an entry =

It is not hard to add an entry in PHP code.

	<?php
		$entry = new gwolle_gb_entry();

		// Set the data in the instance, returns true
		$set_data = $entry->set_data( $args );

		// Save entry, returns the id of the entry
		$save = $entry->save();
	?>

The Array $args can have the following key/values:

* id, int with the id, leave empty for a new entry.
* author_name, string with the name of the autor.
* author_id, id with the WordPress user ID of the author.
* author_email, string with the email address of the author.
* author_origin, string with the city of origin of the author.
* author_website, string with the website of the author.
* author_ip, string with the ipaddress of the author.
* author_host, string with the hostname of that ip.
* content, string with content of the message.
* date, timestamp of the entry.
* ischecked, bool if it is checked by a moderator.
* checkedby, int with the WordPress ID of that moderator.
* istrash, bool if it is in trash or not.
* isspam, bool if it is spam or not.

= Filter an entry on the frontend =

On the frontend you can filter each entry. You can use a function like:

	<?php
	function your_custom_function($entry) {
		// $entry is a string
		$entry = $entry . " Hi There. ";
		return $entry;
	}
	add_filter( 'gwolle_gb_entry_read', 'your_custom_function');
	?>

= Filter all the entries on the frontend =

You can also filter the complete list of entries.

	<?php
	function your_custom_function($entries) {
		// $entries is a string
		$entries = $entries . " Hello my friend. ";
		return $entries;
	}
	add_filter( 'gwolle_gb_entries_read', 'your_custom_function');
	?>

= Filter the form =

The form can be filtered as well:

	<?php
	function your_custom_function($form) {
		// $form is a string
		$form = $form . " Please fill this in. ";
		return $form;
	}
	add_filter( 'gwolle_gb_write', 'your_custom_function');
	?>

= Filter an entry before saving =

When saving an entry you can filter it like this.

	<?php
	function your_custom_function($entry) {
		// $entry is an array.
		// Example where every entry that gets saved gets the current time
		$entry['date'] = current_time( 'timestamp' );
		return $entry;
	}
	add_filter( 'gwolle_gb_entry_save', 'your_custom_function');
	?>

= Format for importing through CSV-file =

The importer expects a certain format of the CSV-file. If you need to import from a custom solution, your CSV needs to conform.
The header needs to look like this:

	<?php
	array(
		'id',
		'author_name',
		'author_email',
		'author_origin',
		'author_website',
		'author_ip',
		'author_host',
		'content',
		'date',
		'isspam',
		'ischecked',
		'istrash'
	)
	?>

The next lines are made up of the content. Date needs to be a UNIX timestamp. For manually creating a timestamp, look at
the [timestamp generator](http://www.timestampgenerator.com/).
You could make a test-entry, export that, and look to see what the importer expects from the CSV.
Make sure you use UNIX line-endings. Any decent text-editor can transform a textdocument to UNIX line-endings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which entries are visible on the Frontend? =

Starting with version 1.0, the following entries are listed on the Frontend:

* Checked
* Not marked as Spam
* Not in the Trash

Before that, in 0.9.7, all the 'checked' entries were visible.

= I have a lot of unchecked entries. What do I do? =

For the entries that you consider spam, but were not caught by Akismet, you can mark them as spam, and they will not be visible anymore.
For entries that are not spam, but you still don't want them visible, you can move them to trash.
The entries that you want visible, select these to be checked.

= What about Spam? =

Your first option is to use Akismet. It works like a charm. Fighting spam has never been easier.

If that doesn't work enough, use the Custom Anti-Spam question.

You can also use reCAPTCHA. It might scare off some visitors, though.

= I get a warning about another reCAPTCHA library =

Apparently you use a theme or other plugin with its own reCAPTCHA library. If you get a warning that it is old and incompatible, please
ask the maintainer of that theme or plugin to update their version of reCAPTCHA. If the warning is that another version will be used by
Gwolle-GB, and you experience problems when submitting guestbook entries, please tell me on the forums, and also tell me which other plugin
you use.

= My reCAPTCHA doesn't show up in the form. =

If you did enable reCAPTCHA, but didn't get a warning, in most cases it should show your reCAPTCHA. It might be that you have JavaScript errors.
You can check this in the Inspector/console of your browser.

= After submitting a new entry, I get errors about reCAPTCHA. =
If the form gives you errors, even though you filled in everything correctly, there might be something strange happening.
On some setups reCAPTCHA doesn't report Succes or Error. If you are able to debug this, and tell me what is happening, I would be happy to hear that.

= I don't see the labels in the form. =

This plugin doesn't apply any CSS to the label elements. It is possible that your label elements have a white color on a white background.
You can check this with the Inspector in your browser. If that is the case, you have a theme or plugin that is applying that CSS to your
label elements. Please contact them.

= I don't get a notification email. =

First check your spambox in your mailaccount.

Second, on the settingspage you can change the From address for the email that is sent.
Sometimes there are problems sending it from the default address, so this is a good thing to change to a real address.

If it still doesn't work, request the maillog at your hosting provider, or ask if they can take a look.

= I want to show the form and the list on different pages =

There are different shortcodes that you can use. Instead of the [gwolle_gb] shortcode, you can use [gwolle_gb_write] for just the form,
and [gwolle_gb_read] for the list of entries.

= Moderation is enabled, but my entry is marked as checked =

If a user with capability of 'moderate_comments' posts an entry, it will be marked as checked by default, because he can mark it as checked anyway.

= Moderation is disabled, but some entries are still unchecked =

There is validation of the length of words in the content and author name. If the words are too long and it looks
abusive, it will be marked as unchecked. A moderator will still be needed to manually edit and check these entries.

= What capabilities are needed? =

For moderating comments you need the capability 'moderate_comments'.

For managing options you need the capability 'manage_options'.

= Should I really not use WordPress comments for a guestbook? =

Sure you can if you want to. In my personal opinion however it can be a good thing to keep comments and guestbook entries separated.
So if you already have a blog with comments, the guestbook entries might get lost in there, and keeping a separate guestbook can be good.
But if you don't use standard comments, you can just as easily use the comment section for a guestbook.

= How do I localize a plugin? =

A good start to learn about localization and WP plugins is the guide "Localizing a WordPress plugin using poEdit" (http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/08/27/localizing-a-wordpress-plugin-using-poedit/)
and also the WordPress documentation. When you made a translation, you can send the po-file to marcel at timelord.nl.

= Is this plugin actively maintained? =

Yes, it is again actively maintained.

== Screenshots ==

1. Frontend view of the list of guestbook entries. On top the button that will show the form when clicked. Then pagination. Then the list of entries.
2. Dashboard widget with new and unchecked entries.
3. Main page with the overview panel, so that you easily can see what's the overall status.
2. List of guestbook entries. The icons display the status of an entry.
3. The editor for a single entry. The Actions are using AJAX. There is a log of each entry what happened to this entry.
4. Settings panel. This is the first tab where you can select which parts of the form to show and use.

Gwolle-GB is the WordPress guestbook you've just been looking for. Beautiful and easy.


== Description ==

Gwolle-GB is the WordPress guestbook you've just been looking for. Beautiful and easy.
Gwolle Guestbook is not just another guestbook for WordPress. The goal is to provide an easy and slim way to integrate
a guestbook into your WordPress powered site. Don't use your 'comment' section the wrong way - install Gwolle-GB and
have a real guestbook.


Current features include:

* Easy to use guestbook frontend with a simple form for visitors of your website.
* Simple and clean admin interface that integrates seamlessly into WordPress admin.
* Easy import of DMSGuestbook entries into Gwolle-GB.
* Notification by mail when a new entry has been posted.
* Moderation, so that you can check an entry before it is visible in your guestbook (all optional).
* Akismet integration for fighting spam.
* Recaptcha integration for fighting spam, too.
* Localisation (currently English, German, French, Spanish, Polish and Dutch). Own languages can be added very easily,
  check WP documentation on this. If you translated the plugin I'd be glad to include your language in a future release,
  so please send them to my via mail, thanks!
* Different-styled admin entries, so that the visitor can tell which entry is written by the 'real admin'
* A log for each entry, so that you know which member of the staff released and edited a guestbook-entry to the public and when.
* IP-address and host-logging with link to WHOIS query site.
* Smiley integration (uses the WordPress smiley engine).
* Easy uninstall routine for complete removal of all database changes.

... and all that integrated in the stylish WordPress look.

You may have "DMSGuestbook" installed - that's great, because since version 0.9.5 Gwolle-GB enables you
to import DMSGuestbook's entries easily using an assistant. The importer does not delete any of your data,
so you can go back to DMSGuestbook without loss of data, if you want to. Trying Gwolle-GB is as easy as 1-2-3.

Please note: At the moment, Gwolle-GB does *not* work with WordPress MU.

== Installation ==

= Installation =

* Install the plugin through the admin page "Plugins".
* Alternatively, unpack and upload the contents of the zipfile to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
*  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
*  Place '[gwolle_gb]' in a page. That's it.
*  You may disable comments in this post or page, because it may look confusing when there's the possibility to write a guestbook entry.

As an alternative for the shortcode, you can use the function `show_gwolle_gb();` to show the guestbook in your templates.
It couldn't be easier.

= Updating from an old version =

With version 1.0 there have been some changes:

* Gwolle-GB uses the Shortcode API now. Make sure your Guestbook page uses [gwolle_gb] instead of the old one.
* The entries that are visible to visitors have changed. Make sure to check if you have everything
  visible that you want and nothing more.
* CSS has changed somewhat. If you have custom CSS, you want to check if it still applies.

= Todo/coming up in future releases =

First priority is getting the plugin working with current WordPress and resolve a lot of bugs.

* Bughunting (check all the FIXME's in the code).
* Pagination is sometimes funky.
* Bring back ReCaptcha.
* Add possibility to empty trash and spam.
* Make Install method more safe.
* Bring Import method back and refactor it. Add more sources.
* Bring Uninstall back, this time in a separate admin page?
* Bring AJAX back, this time inside actions.
* Bring Frontend Widget and Dashboard Widget back.
* Redo Settings page with tabs for separate parts.
* Add an RSS Feed for Guestbook Entries.
* Better database structure (e. g. 'id' instead of 'entry_id').
* 'Thank you' mail to the poster (requested by Joakim from Sweden).

If you have a feature request please use the forum on WordPress.org. It may be added to the list then.

= Known bugs in 0.9.7 (the old version) =

* Some WP installations with permalinks activated receive a 404-error.
* Some WP installations don't send the notification mails (currently only known from WP MU installations).
* Marking multiple entries as spam sometimes takes very long or results in an error message.

Have something to add here? Please add a new thread in the WP.org forums and tag it with "Gwolle-GB". I am subscribed to that forum,
so I will get your message. Or send me an email: marcel (at) zenoweb (dot) nl. Thanks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which entries are visible on the Frontend? =

Starting with version 1.0, the following entries are listed on the Frontend:
* Checked
* Not in the Trash
* Not marked as Spam
Before that, in 0.9.7, all the 'checked' entries were visible.

= I have a lot of unchecked entries. What do I do? =

For the entries that you consider spam, but were not caught by Akismet, you can mark them as spam, and they will not be visible anymore.
For entries that are not spam, but you still don't want them visible, you can move them to trash.
The entries that you want visible, select these to be checked.

= Why aren't entries really deleted, and instead stored in the database? =

First, it's not a heavy load for the database, and second, it's that if you clicked wrong you're not lost without the possibility
to 'undo' it via your database interface.
In a future version this might be implemented.

= What about Spam? =

Your first option is to use Akismet. It works like a charm. Fighting spam has never been easier.

You can also use ReCaptcha. It helps you and your visitors to fight spam at the slight cost of usability.

= How do I localize a plugin? =

A good start to learn about localization and WP plugins is the guide "Localizing a WordPress plugin using poEdit" (http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/08/27/localizing-a-wordpress-plugin-using-poedit/)
and also the WordPress documentation.

= Is this plugin actively maintained? =

Yes, it is again actively maintained.

== Screenshots ==

2. List of the entries. Notice the icons displaying the status of an entry (Can be turned off in the settings panel).
3. The editor for entries.
4. Settings panel (showing version 0.9.4.1).
